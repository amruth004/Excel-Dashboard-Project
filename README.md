🚗📊 Automobile Sales Analysis – Excel Edition <br>
Hey there, data enthusiast! 👋 Welcome to my Automobile Sales Dataset repository, where spreadsheets meet data storytelling! 🚀

📂 What's Inside?
This repo contains an Excel file packed with insights into automobile sales, straight from Kaggle. The file includes four awesome sheets to guide you through the data journey:

🔹 Original Data – The raw dataset, just as I downloaded it. 🚗🔍
🔹 Cleaned Data – Tidied up for better analysis (because messy data is a no-go! ❌)
🔹 Pivot Tables – Summarized insights at your fingertips! 📊✨
🔹 Dashboard – A visually appealing snapshot of sales trends. 🎨📉

❗ Heads Up!
GitHub doesn’t support direct Excel file previews, so you’ll need to download the file to check it out. I know… a bit of a hassle, but trust me, it’s worth it! 😄

💡 Want to Improve It?
I’d love to hear your suggestions and feedback! Found something interesting? Have ideas for improvement? Drop an issue or fork the repo and make it even cooler. 🚀
