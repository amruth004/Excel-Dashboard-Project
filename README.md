🚗📊 Automobile Sales Analysis – Excel Edition <br>
<br>Hey there, data enthusiast! 👋 Welcome to my Automobile Sales Dataset repository, where spreadsheets meet data storytelling! 🚀<br>
<br>
📂 What's Inside?<br>
This repo contains an Excel file packed with insights into automobile sales, straight from Kaggle. The file includes four awesome sheets to guide you through the data journey:
<br>
🔹 Original Data – The raw dataset, just as I downloaded it. 🚗🔍<br>
🔹 Cleaned Data – Tidied up for better analysis (because messy data is a no-go! ❌)<br>
🔹 Pivot Tables – Summarized insights at your fingertips! 📊✨<br>
🔹 Dashboard – A visually appealing snapshot of sales trends. 🎨📉<br><br>

❗ Heads Up!<br>
GitHub doesn’t support direct Excel file previews, so you’ll need to download the file to check it out. I know… a bit of a hassle, but trust me, it’s worth it! 😄<br>
<br>
